| | The module TN_INPUT_MENU_BAR is used to manage and view the Menu_Bar. The element is shown in *.in_X and *.in_Y. The menu items are stored as elements within verschachelte *.st_MENU_TEXT. Two different separators are used. A '$' separates the different menu lists, and each menu list is further divided by '#' into individual menu items. The first menu list is the actual menu bar, this implies the number of sub-menus, and the titles of the elements. Then all the sub-menu lists are follow and are separated by '%'. To devide individual sub-menu items from each other or providing them with a cut line, an '-' has to submitted as text menu-element. |
| **By pressing the Escape key, the menu bar activated and the respective sub-menu is displayed using the module TN_INPUT_MENU_POPUP. Within the sub-menu can be navigated with up / down key. Within the sub-menu can be navigated with up / down cursor. If a sub-menu item is confirmed by pressing Enter / Return key, then in *.in_Menu_Selected the number of the selected menu-point is passed. The calculation of the menu item number is as following** | Main menu index * 10 + Submenu-index. The entry in *.in_Menu_Selected needs set again to 0 after acceptance by users. |
| | Thus, a maximum of 9 main menu items and each 9-Submenu items are executable. Means of escape key at any time the menu can be hided again. |
| | Active Menu automatically backs up the background before it is drawn, and restores the background after ending. |
| | As long as a menu is display, the user program may not make graphical changes. This can be checked by TN_SCREEN.bo_Menue_Bar_Dialog = TRUE. |
