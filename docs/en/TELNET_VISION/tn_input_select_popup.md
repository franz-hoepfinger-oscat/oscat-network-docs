| | The module TN_INPUT_SELECT_POPUP is used to manage a selection of texts, by displaying a pop-up dialogue. This must be set *.IN_TYPE = 3. | |
| | The item will be provided as *.in_X and *.in_Y. Every entry line can be provided with a title text. With *.in_Title_Y_Offset and *.in_Title_X_Offset  the position relative to the element coordinates is expressed. The color can be determined with *.by_Title_Attr, and the text by *.st_Title_String. If a tool tip should appear at the element *. st_Input_ToolTip the text hast to be specified. | |
| | The selection of texts will be handed over in *.st_Input_Data. The text element should be separated from each other by the character '#'. | |
| | If the focus is on an element, using the Enter / Return key selection dialog can be activated. | |
| | With the cursor up/down can be changed between the individual elements. If the beginning or the end of the list will be reachted, it continues at the opposite side. | |
| | The text-element is connected by means *.st_Input_Mask, meaning that the output text length are affected later. | |
| | By pressing the Enter / Return key is the text of the selected element is passed to *. st_Input_String and *. bo_Input_Entered = TRUE. The input flag must be reset after receive by the user. | |
| | An active selection (selection dialog) can always be canceled with the Escape key. | |
