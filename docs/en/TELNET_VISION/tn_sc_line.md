| | |
|:---|:---|
| **Type** | Function module |
| **INPUT** | Iin_Y1: INT (Y1 coordinate of the line) |
| **Iin_X1** | INT: (X1 coordinate of the line) |
| **Iin_Y2** | INT (Y2 coordinate of the line) |
| **Iin_X2** | INT: (X2-coordinate of the line) |
| **Iby_ATTR** | BYTE: (color code of the line) |
| **Iby_BORDER** | BYTE: (type of line) |
| **IN_OUT	Xus_TN_SCREEN** | Us_TN_SCREEN |
| | The module TN_SC_LINE is used to draw horizontal and vertical lines. By means of the X1/Y1 and X2/Y2 coordinates defines the beginning and the end of the line. The line type is passed by Iin_BORDER and the color code with Iby_ATTR. If when drawing a line and another line of this type cut, automatically the appropriate crossing sign is used. |
| **Border types** |  |
| | 1 = line with single line |
| | 2 = line with double line |
| | > 2 = line is drawn with the specified character in Iin_BORDER |
