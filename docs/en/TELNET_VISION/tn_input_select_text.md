| | The item will be provided as *.in_X and *.in_Y. Every entry line can be provided with a title text. With *.in_Title_Y_Offset and *.in_Title_X_Offset  the position relative to the element coordinates is expressed. The color can be determined with *.by_Title_Attr, and the text by *.st_Title_String. If a tool tip should appear at the element *. st_Input_ToolTip the text hast to be specified. | |
| | The selection of texts will be handed over in *.st_Input_Data. The text element should be separated from each other by the character '#'. | |
| | If the Element has the focus, by using the spacebar (space) can be changed between the individual texts. The text-element is connected by means *.st_Input_Mask, meaning that the output text length are affected later. | |
| | By pressing the Enter / Return key the input text is issued at *.st_Input_String and  *.bo_Input_Entered  ist set to TRUE. The input flag must be reset after receive by the user. | |
