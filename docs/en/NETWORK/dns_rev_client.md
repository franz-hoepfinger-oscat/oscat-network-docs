| | DNS_REV_CLIENT determine from the given IP address   the officially registered domain name. For this purpose a reverse DNS query on the configured IP address with a DNS server is made. With positive edge of ACTIVATE the specified IP is stored so that they no longer must be present. If the query result in more matches, it will always use the last record. As IP4_DNS can be used any public DNS servers. If the PLC is sitting behind a DSL router,   this router can be used as a DNS server through its gateway address. Which ultimately leads to faster even with repeated requests response times because they are managed in the router cache. With positive results DONE = TRUE the DOMAIN contains the officially registered domain name until the start of the next query by positive edge of ACTIVATE. ERROR gives ao error, the error code. (See error codes). | |
