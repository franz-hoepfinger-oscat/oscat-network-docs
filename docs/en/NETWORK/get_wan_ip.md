## Type	Function module:

| | |
|:---|:---|
| **INPUT	ACTIVATE** | BOOL (release for query) |
| **OUTPUT** | WAN_IP: DWORD (Wide Area Network address) |
| **DONE** | BOOL   (Query completed without errors) |
| **ERROR_C** | DWORD   (Error code) |
| **ERROR_T** | BYTE   (error type) |
| | The module determines the IP address that the Internet router on the Wide Area Network (Internet) uses. This IP address is necessary for example to    to make DynDNS declarations. With a positive edge of the ACTIVATE the request is started. After successful completion of the query DONE = TRUE, and the parameters WAN_IP  the current WAN IP address displayed. If an error occurs during the query it is reported in ERROR_C in combination with ERROR_T. |
| **ERROR_T** |  |

IN_OUT	IP_C: data structure 'IP_CONTROL '   (Parameterization)

S_BUF: data structure NETWORK_BUFFER '(transmit data)

R_BUF: data structure 'NETWORK_BUFFER '(receive data)
