| | DNS_CLIENT determine from the given qualified DOMAIN name the associated IPv4 address   eg "www.oscat.de"  . For this purpose, a DNS query to a DNS server for configured DOMAIN name with is made. With positive edge of ACTIVATE the specified DOMAIN is stored so that they no longer must be present. If the query provide more IP addresses, so always  he highest value of the TTL (Time To Live) is used. As IP4_DNS can be used any public DNS servers. If the PLC is sitting behind a DSL router,   this router can be used through its gateway address as a DNS server. Which ultimately leads to faster even with repeated requests response times because they are managed in the router cache. With positive results DONE = TRUE the IP4 contains the requested IP address until the start of the next query by positive edge of ACTIVATE. If in the DOMAIN name a valid IPv4 address is detected, no more DNS query is made and it is passed in  converted type to IPv4 and DONE is set to TRUE. ERROR gives, if an error occurs, the exact cause. | |
